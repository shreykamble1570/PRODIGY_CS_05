Network Packet Analyzer
Overview
The Network Packet Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to capture and analyze network packets. This tool leverages the scapy library to sniff network traffic and extract relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. It is intended for educational purposes and ethical use, helping users understand network communications and identify potential security issues.

Features
Packet Capture: Sniffs network packets in real-time.
Protocol Identification: Identifies TCP and UDP protocols.
Information Extraction: Extracts and displays source and destination IP addresses, ports, and payload data.
Ethical Use: Ensures compliance with ethical guidelines for network monitoring.
Requirements
To run the Network Packet Analyzer, you need:

Python 3.x
scapy library
You can install the required library using pip:

bash

pip install scapy
Installation
Clone the Repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-packet-analyzer.git

cd network-packet-analyzer
Install Dependencies:
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To start the Network Packet Analyzer, run the following command:

bash

python packet_analyzer.py
The script will begin capturing network packets and displaying relevant information in the console.

How It Works
The Network Packet Analyzer uses the scapy library to sniff network traffic. When a packet is captured, the script checks if it contains IP layer information. It then determines the protocol (TCP or UDP) and extracts source and destination IP addresses, ports, and payload data. This information is printed to the console for analysis.

Packet Callback Function
The packet_callback function is responsible for processing each captured packet. It checks if the packet contains IP layer information and then determines the protocol (TCP or UDP). It extracts source and destination IP addresses, ports, and payload data, then prints this information.

Main Function
The main function starts the packet sniffing process using the sniff function from scapy. The prn parameter specifies the callback function to process each packet, and store=0 indicates that packets should not be stored in memory.

Ethical Considerations
It is crucial to use the Network Packet Analyzer ethically and responsibly. Unauthorized packet sniffing is illegal and unethical. Ensure you have proper authorization to capture and analyze network traffic. Use this tool only on networks you own or have explicit permission to monitor.
